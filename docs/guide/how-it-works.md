# How It Works

Mint is an opinionated protocol to enable artists to create, manage and sell
their collections on Ethereum, in an open yet self-controlled environment.

Creators deploy collection contracts via a Mint Factory.

Creators mint artifacts on these collections. The base implementation
encourages storing artifacts fully onchain, but creators are free to
store their art however they like. Artists can register custom
renderer contracts for each token they create, encouraging
custom & novel ways to resolve and display their art.

Minted artifacts are open to be collected for 24 hours after creation.

Prices are tied 1:1 to the network (gas) cost of a mint on Ethereum.
50% of the proceeds go to the artist, 50% is burned as per the rules
of the Ethereum network. Creators can support the artist by minting
multiple of the token, which decreases this ratio in favor of the
artist. There are no third parties or protocol fees.

There are no limits as to how many tokens can be purchased.

After a mint closes, items can be traded like other tokens on
Ethereum through third party protocols.
