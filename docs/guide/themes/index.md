# Introduction To Themes

The base mint app implementation allows registering themes on top of it,
which extend its functionality and adjust its styling. Using themes makes it incredibly
easy to switch between different styles quickly and enables developers to share
their versions of the app easily with many artists.

Themes, just like the base app, can be extended and customized further.

Think of this like Wordpress themes and plugins, but for the Mint protocol.
