# What It Is & Isn't

## What It Is

Mint is an open source toolkit for creating and releasing digital
artifacts on Ethereum Mainnet (L1).

Mint is a set of smart contracts that streamline the deployment
of new collection contracts.

Mint is an application framework and set of UI components that facilitate
interacting with those smart contracts for both artists and collectors.

Mint makes easy for artists to create and customize their own website,
and to showcase and sell their work however they like.

Mint enables developers to build custom experiences on top of the core protocol
by creating novel artifact renderers and/or UI components and themes that artists
can use to showcase their work.

Mint allows collecting digital art as "networked artifacts".
Each piece is owned by a network of supporters.

Most importantly: Mint is a gift.

## What It Is Not

Mint is not a "platform" or hosted application for you to use.
Anyone can run a version of Mint on their computer,
or host one on a server for others to use.

Mint does not run on proprietary APIs or services.
Everything is powered by Ethereum and the open web.

Mint does not facilitate selling 1/1 art or running auctions.
We believe there is no reason for constraining ownership of
digital artifacts to individuals. Mints are owned by their
networks of supporters. The truly scarce characteristic
is the time and place artifacts are distributed, not
how often, or for whatever consensus on price.

Mint is not an invitation for you to tell us what to do for you.
