# What It Is & Isn't

## What It Is

Mint is an open source toolkit for creating and releasing digital artifacts
on Ethereum Mainnet (L1).

Mint is a set of smart contracts that streamline the
deployment of new collection contracts.

Mint allows collecting digital art as networked artifacts, so each
piece is owned by a network of supporters.

Mint is an application framework and set of UI components that facilitate
interacting with those smart contracts for both artists and collectors.

Mint makes easy for artists to create and customize their own website,
and to showcase and sell their work however they like.

Mint enables developers to build custom experiences on top of the core protocol
by creating novel artifact renderers and/or UI components and themes that artists
can use to showcase their work.

Most importantly: Mint is a gift.

## What It Is Not

Mint is not a platform or hosted application for you to use.

It is not an API. Everything runs on Ethereum & the open web. There are no APIs.
We don't provide any APIs. Applications are simple browser-rendered user interfaces
that let users interact with Ethereum directly.

Mint does not facilitate selling 1/1 art or running auctions.
We believe there is no reason for digital artifacts not to be owned by networks.
The truly scarce characteristic is the time and place artifacts are distributed,
not how often, or for whatever consensus of price.

Have a feature idea? Build it. Mint is not an invitation for you to tell
us what to do for you.
