# Introduction

> “To mint is a human right, and your right is your responsibility.”

Mint is an internet protocol enabling the creation and collection of
digital artifacts on the Ethereum Virtual Machine.

It reimagines the relationship between creators, collectors,
and the network itself, positioning Ethereum as both a virtual
plane of existence and a new kind of public (art) institution.

Mint prices artifacts based on the network fees at the time of creation.
The cost to store and secure the object on the network is mirrored as
compensation to the artist, creating a direct link between network
value and creator reward and a transparent pricing mechanism
where the cost reflects the true expense of
securing the artifact on the blockchain.

Mint recognizes that true scarcity lies in creativity and time,
not artificial limits. It enforces scarcity through the
moment of creation, not volume restrictions.
This approach assumes that truly valuable artifacts will
naturally rise to the top without artificial scarcity.

Mint challenges the notion of "adoption" as a primary goal.
Instead, it focuses on creating a robust, self-sustaining
ecosystem where value flows directly between the network
and creators. By framing minting as both a right and a
responsibility, it encourages thoughtful participation
in the digital artifact economy.

This protocol isn't just about digital art; it's about forging
a new relationship between humans, their creations, and the
digital infrastructure that enables global, permissionless
creativity. Mint paves the way for a future where digital
artifacts are as significant and valuable as their
physical counterparts, secured and valued by
the very network that gives them life.
