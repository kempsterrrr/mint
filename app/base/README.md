# Mint App

This application interacts with the "Mint" Factory + Collection contracts.
It enables artists to mint and sell their art on Ethereum mainnet
while maintaining full control over the contracts and with all freedom
to customize the application to their liking.

This application is built with VueJS and Nuxt;
two beautiful frameworks for building web based interfaces.
