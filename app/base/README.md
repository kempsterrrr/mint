# Mint App

This application is built with VueJS and Nuxt; two beautiful frameworks for building web based interfaces. Look at the [Nuxt 3 documentation](https://nuxt.com/docs/getting-started/introduction) to learn more.

## Setup

Make sure to install the dependencies:

```bash
yarn install
```

## Development Server

Start the development server on `http://mint.test:1618`:

```bash
yarn dev
```

## To-Do's

- [ ] Refactor AppHeader titles (breadcrumb). This is quite hacky right now.
