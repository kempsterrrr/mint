# Mint &lt;/&gt;

Mint is a simple protocol on Ethereum mainnet, allowing artists to create,
manage and sell their collections easily. It offers opinionated standard
contract deployment and mint functionality while ensuring artists and
developers can build custom extensions like novel
metadata renderers on top.

Mint Artifacts are priced based on the Ethereum network fees
at the time of collecting.

Network fees (Gas fees) are an essential component of of securing
and running decentralized blockchains.

The cost to store and secure the object on the network is mirrored
as compensation to the artist, creating a direct link
between network value and creator reward.
