# Mint

happy birthday ethereum

## Intro

Mint is a simple protocol on Ethereum mainnet, allowing artists to create, manage and sell
their collections easily. It encourages artists to mint immutable artifacts and
offers opinionated standard contract deployment and mint functionality while ensuring
artists and developers can build custom extensions like metadata renderers
on top of the base rails.

Artifacts are priced based on the Ethereum network fees at the time of collecting.

Network fees (Gas fees) are an essential component of of securing
and running decentralized blockchains.

The cost to store and secure the object on the network is mirrored
as compensation to the artist, creating a direct link
between network value and creator reward.
